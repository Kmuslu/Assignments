Task:

Find out if a given number is an "Armstrong Number".

An n-digit number that is the sum of the nth powers of its digits is called an n-Armstrong number. Examples :
371 = 33 + 73 + 13;
9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44;
93084 = 95 + 35 + 05 + 85 + 45.

Write a Python program that;
takes a positive integer number from the user,
checks the entered number if it is Armstrong,
consider the negative, float and any entries other than numeric values then display a warning message to the user.

Examples
Sample inputs	Outputs
407	407 is an Armstrong number
5	5 is an Armstrong number
-153	 It is an invalid entry. Don't use non-numeric, float, or negative values!
153.87 or 153,87	 It is an invalid entry. Don't use non-numeric, float, or negative values!
one	 It is an invalid entry. Don't use non-numeric, float, or negative values!
121	 121 is not an Armstrong number

SOLUTION:

while True:
    number = input("Enter a positive number  : ")
    digits = len(number)
    summ = 0 
    if not number.isdigit() :
        print(number, "It is an invalid entry. Don't use non-numeric, float, or negative values!")
    elif int(number) >= 0:
        for i in range(digits):
            summ += int(number[i]) ** digits
        if summ == int(number):
            print(number,"is an Armstrong number")
            break
        else:
            print(number,"is not an Armstrong number")
            break
