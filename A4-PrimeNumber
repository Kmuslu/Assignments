Task : Write a program that takes a number from the user and prints the result to check if it is a prime number.

The examples of the desired output are as follows :

input →  19 ⇉ output : 19 is a prime number
input →  10 ⇉ output : 10 is not a prime number

SOLUTION:

number = int(input("enter a number to check if it is a prime number or composite number: "))

count = 0

for i in range(1, number+1) :
    if not(number% i):
        count += 1
if (number== 0) or (number == 1) or (count >= 3):
   print(number, "is a composite number.")
else :
    print(number, "is a prime number.")
