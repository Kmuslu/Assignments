Task : Create a list consisting of Fibonacci numbers from 1 to 55 using control flow statements.

The desired output is like :

fibonacci â†’  [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]

SOLUTION:

fibonacci = [] # emptylist to add our numbers.

for i in range(-2,8): 
    if i < 0:
        fibonacci.append(1)

# I need to have two 1s as my first and second elements in my list. That's why I started 
                        with -2 and set the condition i < 0. 
#First loop: -2 < 0, print 1.
#Second loop: -1 < 0, print another 1.
#Third loop: 0 < 0 is false so it will exit from if condition and try the next condition. 
#fibonacci = [1,1]

    else:
        fibonacci.append(fibonacci[i]+fibonacci[i+1]) 
# Now new elements will be added according to the operation abow. 
# i = 0: the digit in 0 place and the digit in 1st(0+1= 1) place will be added and sum will be added 
as a new element in the list. 
#List will go on till i = 7.


print(fibonacci)

OUTPUT: fibonacci = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
